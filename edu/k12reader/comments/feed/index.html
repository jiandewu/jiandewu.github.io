&quot;While phonological awareness encompasses a child’s ability to recognize the many ways sounds function in words, phonological awareness is only her understanding of the most minute sound units in words.&quot; The second phonological awareness should read phonemic awareness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your insights, especially the &quot;Reading Material&quot; section how you talk about looking into “edgy” books like &quot;graphic novels and higher-level picture books that are designed to engage reluctant readers.&quot;   I would agree from my experience in teaching reluctant readers that these texts don&#039;t “dumb down” reading, but &quot;provide valuable experiences with reading.&quot;  My struggling middle school readers have become engaged when provided the literature that is just right for them.  I have some examples of this type of reading material on my &quot;Devious Devin&quot; blog and I&#039;m working on adding teaching resources.  Enjoy!]]></description>
