    by:
  <em>Maurice Sendak</em> - (Harper Collins, 1963) <em>48 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Originally published in 1963, this is the story of Max, who puts on a wolf suit, causes mischief, gets sassy with his mother and is sent to bed without any dinner. The story is one of escaping into a child&#8217;s imagination when he&#8217;s on the outs with Mom. Max&#8217;s room becomes a forest, he finds he has his own boat and then sails off &#8220;in and out of weeks&#8230;to the place where the wild things are.&#8221; There, he is not impressed with the posturing of the wild things, and without much ado, he becomes their king. The color illustrations are some of Sendak&#8217;s best (he won the 1964 Caldecott Medal for them), and the wild things are very huggable-looking. This is a bedtime classic that transcends time. </p>

By the time the frightening day arrives, Wemberly is full of dread. At school, the teacher introduces her to another girl mouse, Jewel. Making a new friend doesn’t magically fix things, of course, but it helps &mdash; a lot. When Jewel plays with her, Wemberly still continues to worry, “But no more than usual. And sometimes even less.”</p>

It does, however, have rules about behavior and when the lion, who has jauntily sauntered in the front door to join story hour, roars in distress when the program is over, the head librarian, Miss Merriweather, turns stern. &#8220;If you cannot be quiet, you will have to leave. Those are the rules&#8230;.&#8221; An agreement is brokered by the children and Miss Merriweather concedes that &#8220;Yes, a nice quiet lion would certainly be allowed to come back for story hour tomorrow.&#8221; &#8230; This gentle story, which toys with a host of library stereotypes, succeeds by virtue of that most winning of all combinations: humor and humanity.</p>

If kids are fine with the darker moments of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales, they&#8217;ll be OK with this one, especially if your reading focuses on the clever and humorous elements and the very happy ending.</p>

In Jane Yolen&#8217;s gentle new bedtime book, we see how hibernating animals everywhere use wintertime for sweet dreams. The black bear, for example, hibernates &#8220;through winter&#8217;s snow,&#8221; and waits &#8220;till spring to rise and go,&#8221; while the bats tuck their &#8220;legs in tight, for winter&#8217;s dark extended night.&#8221; Authors Jane Yolen and Heidi E.Y.

  <div class="body"><p>First-time picture book author Diesen&#8217;s splashy, colorful Pout-Pout Fish is an empathetic swim through the currents of those &#8220;dreary-wearies&#8221; that make the Pout-Pout Fish pout! With a seemingly permanent grouchy countenance, Mr. Fish encounters numerous friends, like Mr. Jelly, Mr. Eight (the octopus) and Mrs. Squid, who ask him with playful rhymes why he can&#8217;t turn his frown upside-down. The answer from Mr. Fish is delightful, and a sure crowd-pleaser: &#8220;I&#8217;m a pout-pout fish/With a pout-pout face/So I spread the dreary-wearies/All over the place!/BLUB/BLUUUB/ BLUUUUUB.&#8221; Luckily, Mr. Fish has lots of undersea friends to reassure him that he shouldn&#8217;t be so grumpy, but it takes a kissy-kissy fish to rid Mr. Fish of his dreary-wearies for good. Delightful, vibrant, colorful illustrations, with smart, fun rhymes and a refrain that kids will recite over and over. A great book for audience participation or one-on-one to help cheer up little pouters.</p>

The story is laid out almost like a concrete poem &mdash; when a squirrel scampers in circles, so do the words on the page &mdash; and Perkins&#8217;s soft watercolors perfectly illustrate the snow-covered landscape.

Although he&#8217;s disappointed when he finds that he can&#8217;t save a snowball in his pocket, his sadness melts when he wakes up the next morning to yet another day of snowy fun. Keats&#8217;s collage-style illustrations are wonderful — especially the sharp contrast of Peter in his red snow suit (with its little pointy hood) against the snowy landscape. Keats&#8217;s classic <em>Snowy Day</em> beautifully captures a child&#8217;s sense of wonder.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Queen Daisy has a problem that many wiggly children will be able to identify with: Her feet just can&#8217;t behave themselves. They want to wear wild and colorful boots and fuzzy slippers &mdash; or nothing at all! They want to wade in pond water, tap dance and discover puddles. Unfortunately, Queen Daisy&#8217;s court and subjects do not approve. Sarah Ellis&#8217;s new picture book The Queen&#8217;s Feet is a silly but totally relatable story about finding a middle ground &mdash; something most children need to find for themselves as well. It can be tricky learning when certain behavior is appropriate and when it&#8217;s not, but Queen Daisy&#8217;s situation and solution teach the concept well without any preaching. Dusan Petricic&#8217;s watercolor and pen-and-ink illustrations are upbeat and comical, and in most cases take a &#8220;foot&#8217;s eye&#8221; point of view of the action. A fun book for young children at that age where sitting still is a real effort.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Have you ever wondered what goes on in your cat&#8217;s mind? I don&#8217;t think that this book quite answers the question, but it does start you thinking. This is an amusing take on the inner life of one Walter Kitty (aka &#8220;Fang&#8221;), loosely styled after the famous short story by James Thurber. Great, active illustrations help support the funny narrative. One of my favorite parts is when Walter talks about how much he helps out around the house when he is actually making a big mess and frustrating his owners. Kids don&#8217;t have to be cat owners or feline devotees to appreciate this book, as they will easily identify with the rich, inner world of Walter&#8217;s make-believe exploits.</p>

  <h2>On Earth</h2>  <p class="mbm">
    by:
  <em>G. Brian Karas</em> - (Putnam, 2005) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>In this book, kids will get a first glimpse of how their everyday observations are connected to the larger life of the planet. Karas takes readers on &#8220;a giant ride in space/spinning like a merry-go-round&#8221; With minimal text, the book explains in words and colorful pictures the Earth&#8217;s daily and yearly cycles. Although the concepts are complex, children will get a rudimentary explanation of the orbit, rotation and tilt of planet Earth, gravity, why we have seasons, and what happens as day turns into night. Vocabulary is simple for early readers, but because the scientific concepts are complex, some adult explanation will be welcome.</p>
