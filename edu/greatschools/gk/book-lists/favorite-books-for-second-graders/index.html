  <div class="body"><p>Children don&#8217;t often want to be singled out by their teachers, but this is just what happens when Bob learns that he &mdash; horror of horrors! &mdash; is, in fact, a palindrome. Soon Bob begins to spot these forward/backward verbal oddities everywhere &#8211; in his family, out on the street, even while running away on a ship (where the available jobs involve radar or the rotor). Bob&#8217;s manic struggle to escape this bothersome label is both silly and clever, and his final &#8220;solution&#8221; to the dilemma is the book&#8217;s punch line. Author Mark Shulman and illustrator Adam McCauley embed more than 101 palindromes in the text and pictures, making this wacky story a highly visual exercise in wordplay. &#8230; A fun read-aloud for children and parents (or teachers) to share. </p>

    by:
  <em>Andrew Clements</em>, illustrated by:<em> Tim Bowers</em> - (Simon & Schuster, 2007) <em>40 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Dogku is a clever and sweet little story about a stray dog who finds a loving home. Such plots are a staple of children&#8217;s literature and entertainment, but what sets this book apart is the method of telling the tale &mdash; each page is written in haiku. &#8230; For example, Clements writes: &#8220;Morning brings children/Hugs, licks, barking, and laughing./Warmer than sunshine.&#8221; The oil on canvas illustrations by Tim Bowers are just as warm and cheerful as the text. There is a helpful author&#8217;s note at the end of the book, giving a simple and enthusiastic explanation of haiku for the child reader. &#8230; A novel way for young children to experiment with language. </p>

  <div class="body"><p>This Caldecott Honor book presents an understated retelling of the Grimm classic. Zelinsky&#8217;s paintings in this work originally published in 1984 show the beauty and lushness that would result in his 1998 Caldecott Medal for Rapunzel. This is a beautiful and scary world, and the effect is heightened by Lesser&#8217;s spare, poetic language. Zelinsky&#8217;s artwork makes this version one that children will not soon forget. The story captures childhood fears and yearnings: abandonment, fantastic candy supplies and reuniting with loved ones. Classic folktales survive and are retold over and over because they serve the purpose of helping protect our children. Luckily for us, such artistry as Zelinsky&#8217;s help to bring the point home with shadows and magic, elegance and grace.</p>

She&#8217;s a likable character who has good friends and a couple of enemies, including a sharp-nosed teacher named Miss Hardbroom. Children fall from broomsticks, are turned into animals by the wrong spells and threatened by a band of misfit witches. </p>

What was slavery and how did it end? What happened to the freed slaves? What was the Civil Rights era?

Little girls who dance in the welcome downpour are joined by their Mamas, who can&#8217;t resist the cleansing storm either. With rich word choice that sizzles, thunders, drenches and simmers, the story concludes with a parched city now glistening after a rain storm that refreshes even the reader. </p>

  <h2>Soupy Saturdays with the Pain and the Great One</h2>  <p class="mbm">
    by:
  <em>Judy Blume</em>, illustrated by:<em> James Stevenson</em> - (Delacorte Press, 2007) <em>108 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This book is about an older sister (&#8220;the Great One&#8221;) and a younger brother (&#8220;the Pain&#8221;). Each chapter is told from alternating perspectives, so both kids get equal time telling their stories, which are funny, realistic and endearing. Though they both make cases for detesting each other, it is clear that the siblings are close. For example, when the Pain is afraid to get his hair cut, the Great One makes him a pair of fake ears, saying that if he wears one and gets cut, the barber will suffer from the curse that she placed on the ears. A perfect read-aloud for the whole family, this can easily be read by a newer reader. Parents who grew up on Judy Blume will enjoy it, as I did. Siblings will empathize with the characters, and everyone will laugh at the situations that are unmistakably &#8220;Judy Blume.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Tacky is back, getting himself into predicaments that can only result in delighted, yet understanding, young readers. This time, Tacky is surfing while his more subdued penguin pals are napping on their iceberg. Tacky&#8217;s flowered shirt catches a mighty gust of wind and he is transported to a tropical island. An elephant (Tacky thinks she&#8217;s a large grey rock) mistakes Tacky&#8217;s shirt for a perfect bouquet of flowers to grace her kitchen table. What can Tacky do to escape? He does &#8220;penguinish&#8221; things to prove he is not a table dressing: He marches, dives, slides and hops until the tablecloth is covered with food. As usual, Munsinger&#8217;s watercolor illustrations are hilarious, and the story is told in Lester&#8217;s dry, witty tone. Tacky will certainly find new fans with this book, while old fans will be reminded to reread the other Tacky books!</p>

Families who read this book could discuss the science behind it, the sleuthing and inferences made by paleontologists. How did they figure out what the dinosaurs looked like and ate? What has caused their ideas to change? Families can also do further research together on the types of dinosaurs presented, or find out about other species. </p>

One day a diner complains that her French-fried potatoes, a fashionable new dish at the time, are cut too thick. In a fit of aggravation and to teach the customer a lesson, George accidentally creates the all-American snack food, potato chips. The lively and comical acrylic illustrations add to the fun of this quirky true-life story. </p>

Smaller creatures like the atlas moth fit comfortably on the page, but the head of the saltwater crocodile requires a fold-out, and the head of the Siberian tiger extends off of two large pages! Text is minimal, usually restricted to statistics about the size of each of the creatures illustrated, but there are additional notes about each of the animals at the end of the book.</p>
