  <h2>I Am the Ice Worm</h2>  <p class="mbm">
    by:
  <em>MaryAnn Easley</em> - (Boys Mill Press, 1996) <em>127 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This book is sort of a girls&#8217; version of Gary Paulsen&#8217;s classic Hatchet. In both stories, a teenage character is stranded in the wilderness following a plane crash. In <em>I Am the Ice Worm</em>, 14-year-old Allison is rescued from the Alaskan wild by an Inupiat trapper, who takes her to his village to stay until she can be reunited with her mother. Allison&#8217;s upbringing in an upper-class family in southern California certainly didn&#8217;t prepare her for this icy adventure, but she turns out to have courage and adaptability that she didn&#8217;t expect. Though Allison may initially seem too &#8220;girly&#8221; for boy readers, this novel has a great blend of adventure, wilderness and family matters that will captivate boys and girls alike.</p>

  <h2>Hatchet</h2>  <p class="mbm">
    by:
  <em>Gary Paulsen</em> - (Simon & Schuster, 1987) <em>192 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>The story is about Brian, 13, and how he manages to survive 54 days in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. Brian was flying to visit his father when the pilot dies of a heart attack in mid-flight. Brian crash lands the plane into a small lake and swims out of the wreckage. He has his clothing, a tattered windbreaker and a hatchet (a gift from his mother). The novel takes us through Brian&#8217;s days, how he learns patience through his experiences with failures and small successes: building a fire, fishing and hunting, making his shelter a safe one. He endures a porcupine attack, a tornado and being utterly alone for almost two months. This is a tale of adventure but, more importantly, it is a tale of character growth. This edition includes a new introduction and sidebar commentary by the author. </p>

  <div class="body"><p>When 14-year-old Peak Marcello is caught scaling a skyscraper to place his signature graffiti tag, he is offered a choice: spend three years in juvenile detention or climb Mt. Everest with his long-absent father. Though the choice might be easy, the journey is not. Peak is physically and emotionally challenged by the grueling climb, the weather, and the politics and drama of climbing culture. And the pressure is on, because if Peak can reach the summit before his 15th birthday, he&#8217;ll break a world record and gain glory and money. Peak is gripping and surprising, and though it&#8217;s written for a middle-grade audience, readers young and old will be sucked in by the sharp writing and memorable characters. </p>

  <div class="body"><p>Life in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1912 wasn&#8217;t easy. &#8230; Born to Italian immigrants, Rosa&#8217;s parents and older sister work in the mills. After her father died in a mill accident, Rosa&#8217;s mother took in a family of boarders. Even though they needed the money, Rosa&#8217;s feisty mother insisted that 12-year-old Rosa attend school rather than work in the mill. &#8230; With her unfailing empathy for the young, Paterson combines the thoughts and feelings of a timid child who is torn between the admonitions of an admired teacher who talks against an unfolding mill strike and her earthy Italian mother who, along with Rosa&#8217;s older sister, participates wholeheartedly in the strike. &#8230; Once again, Paterson displays her gift for bringing the hard past to life for present-day readers.</p>

    by:
  <em>Scott O'Dell</em> - (Yearling, 1971) <em>192 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>The Newbery Medal winner for 1961, this book could be seen as a precursor to Gary Paulsen&#8217;s Hatchet (see below). Karana is a 12-year-old Native American who refuses to abandon her 6-year-old brother when her island, Ghalas-at (off the Southern California coast) is evacuated. Shortly thereafter, he tragically dies after being attacked by wild dogs, and Karana begins her solitary wait for a ship to come for her. She waits 18 years. Karana survives by foraging, fishing in the ocean, defending herself from wild dogs and elephant seals, and hiding from the Aleut tribe. Told from her point of view, we share the details of her day-to-day life, watch the days turn into years, and wait for the ship to carry her off her lonely island. O&#8217;Dell based this novel on an actual historical figure, known as The Lost Woman of San Nicolas, who lived on the island from 1835-1853.</p>

  <em>Robbie Scott and Gary Cianciarulo</em> - (Greenwich Mill Pub., 2007) <em>207 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This is great historical fiction for children. The story takes place in 1866 at the tip of the Marin Headlands in Northern California. Shipwrecks, pirate adventure, bigotry, friendships, local flavor &mdash; this book has it all to hold the attention of the tween crowd. The protagonists are Emma, Sue and Harris (all 12 years old) and Rascal Pratt, a self-proclaimed pirate who is older than he looks. Achilles, Sue&#8217;s grandfather, a blind, Native American ranch worker, asks Rascal to find the long-lost treasure of Sir Francis Drake, so that he can buy his freedom from the ranch. The action takes place at a lighthouse and the nearby shoreline and ocean. Because of the wonderful period detail found here, this book is a perfect tie-in for &#8220;Talk Like a Pirate Day&#8221; on September 19!</p>

  <em>Richard Peck</em> - (Dial Books, 2007) <em>148 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This book is a funny, poignant book about life on the home front during World War II. There is some violence: a father is knocked out with a wrench, a girl&#8217;s hand is caught in a rat trap, and an old lady likes to tell tales of gruesome injuries. Families can talk about the differences between life then and now. What aspects of Davy&#8217;s life sound similar to your own? Which are completely different? Does it sound like it was fun to grow up then? Is it more fun now? What else have you seen and read about World War II? </p>

    by:
  <em>Gary Blackwood</em> - (Puffin Books, 1998) <em>216 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Fourteen-year-old orphan Widge works for a mean and unscrupulous master who goes by the name of Falconer. Ordered to steal the script for Hamlet, Widge is taken to London and forced to attend a performance of the play. Instead of concentrating on stealing the script, he becomes engrossed in the show. Reluctantly, Widge admits his failure to Falconer and is told to return until his mission is accomplished. Nothing goes as planned and a very surprised Widge finds himself an accepted member of the backstage crew. Once a lonely outcast, he has friends and a place to call home for the first time in his life. Will he have the moral integrity to disobey his master or will he betray his new family? Set in Elizabethan London, The Shakespeare Stealer introduces us to Shakespearean stagecraft, life on the streets of London and to the truth behind the youthful appearance of Queen Elizabeth I! </p>

    by:
  <em>Andrew Clements</em>, illustrated by:<em> Mark Elliott</em> - (Simon & Schuster, 2007) <em>146 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This is an ear-to-ear-grinningly delightful school story. Parents need to know that there is nothing to be concerned about here and lots to cheer. It&#8217;s a story that even reluctant readers can love, about good-hearted children and adults who grow in compassion and understanding. Families can talk about silence and civil disobedience. Why does the silence seem so powerful? How does it change everyone&#8217;s perceptions? What do you think of the standoff between Dave and the principal?</p>

Like other books of its time, Pollyanna contains a few comments that are considered racist by modern standards: a maid is referred to as &#8220;Black Tilly,&#8221; and there are several comments to the effect that little boys from India are &#8220;heathens&#8221; who &#8220;don&#8217;t know any more than to think that God was in that [idol].&#8221;</p>

That leaves Presbyterian Holling alone every Wednesday afternoon with his teacher, Mrs. Baker. Neither of them is happy at the prospect, and Holling is sure Mrs. Baker hates him as a result. At first, Mrs. Baker just has Holling clean erasers, but then decides to make better use of the time by introducing him to Shakespeare. And as events in the larger world during the 1967-68 school year unfold in the background, Holling begins to learn about himself, his family, friends and the mysterious adult world.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Main characters not only compete in an academic contest (contest answers included at the back!) but also outwit the class bullies using brains, not brawn. Nadia, Noah, Ethan and Julian, so closely linked in friendship that they call themselves &#8220;the Souls,&#8221; each narrates a part of the book. Part of the pleasure comes from watching the foursome&#8217;s varied life experiences help them succeed as an Academic Bowl Team, and part comes from the suspense generated at the story&#8217;s beginning: How does Mrs. Olinski select the children for her team? Only Noah, Nadia, Ethan, and Julian know &amp;mdash; and in alternating chapters, each one tells a different piece of the story of how they became friends. The calamitous wedding of Nadia&#8217;s grandfather and Ethan&#8217;s grandmother, where Noah fills in as best man, is just the beginning. Mrs. Olinski, a paraplegic, proves to be an indomitable coach as the foursome wins one victory after another.</p>

Haroun, Rashid&#8217;s son, searches for the mysterious cause of his father&#8217;s loss and remedy to restore his talent. He encounters situations and characters of great originality, humor and imagination in a fast-moving tale full of word play and clever dialogue.</p>

That is what sisters Sabrina and Daphne Grimm thought until their parents mysteriously disappeared one day. After being shuffled through several foster homes, they end up with a woman named Relda Grimm. Relda claims to be their grandmother and informs the sisters that the fairy tales are actually historical events collected by their ancestors, whose role has always been to maintain the fragile peace between the humans and the Everafters, the proper term for fairy-tale creatures. Daphne, the younger sister, loves Relda and their new life, while Sabrina is skeptical. Everything changes, however, when their grandmother and Mr. Canis, the butler, are kidnapped by a giant and the girls have no choice but to rescue their newfound family.</p>

Roald Dahl and Quentin Blake have teamed up again to create the companion volume to his first culinary compendium, Roald Dahl&#8217;s Revolting Recipes. Aficionados will recognize some of the dishes from Mr. Dahl&#8217;s other works, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. While some of the recipes may sound fairly disgusting, none of them really is. The titles alone are enough to fill young and mischievous cooks with glee as they look forward to presenting company with a plate of Soil with Engine Oil or some Boiled Slobbages. Parents, please note: While the dishes are calculated to appeal to younger appetites, the directions may get a bit overwhelming for junior chefs. Adult supervision is the rule rather than the exception here, so get a firm grip on your sense of humor and wade on in. Who knew lizard&#8217;s tails could be so tasty?</p>

  <div class="body"><p>This is the second book in a five-book series and actually the best one to start with. Cooper convincingly combines fantasy elements with folklore and mythology. Events coincide with significant dates, such as Will&#8217;s birthday, which is close to Christmas and Twelfth Night, and the use of circles to create a link between the Six Signs and the power of the Light add to this story&#8217;s mystical aura. Will Stanton meets his destiny on his 11th birthday. He is the Sign-Seeker, last of the immortal Old Ones, who must find and guard the six great Signs of the Light that will overcome the ancient evil that is overpowering the land. This classic fantasy is a bit slow, but enthralling.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>The richly detailed Pirateology (the latest of the popular &#8216;Ology books) is a standout among pirate merchandise, and a treat for both children and adults. This hefty volume centers on the search for treasure left by the &#8220;notorious&#8221; (i.e., fictional) pirate Arabella Drummond and comes with a host of pirate gear: a compass, maps and scraps of flags, among others. Pirateology is loaded with envelopes to be opened, journals and letters to pore over, and codes to be deciphered. Along the way, children learn about navigation, history, zoology and more. Real pirate lore is seamlessly blended with fictional narrative (even the publishing credits are disguised so as not to break the mood), and the old-fashioned illustrations are top notch. Another notable feature is that the pirate pursued here is female, making this book appeal to readers of both genders.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Max, who struggles with a learning disability, is big compared to other kids his age — though he’s not as big as his violent, convict father, who is in prison for killing Max’s mother. Brilliant, tiny Kevin suffers from a crippling disease that causes him to wear leg braces and keeps his body from growing. The two eighth grade outcasts form a powerfully symbiotic friendship, each drawing on the other’s strengths as they face bullies and more serious dangers together. This poignant, often funny book deals with intense subject matter and packs strong messages about friendship, bravery, and accepting those who are different.</p>
