    by:
  <em>Amy Zuckerman and Jim Daly</em>, illustrated by:<em> John Manders</em> - (Dutton, 2009) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>A talking dog, a housecleaning robot and a three-dimensional &#8220;data orb&#8221; are among the many cool features that kids might enjoy in the future, according to this lighthearted look at 2030. The breezy narrative follows one boy through a typical day, highlighting many interesting aspects of his world. Fanciful cartoon drawings show a lively and appealing world full of new and intriguing activities that correspond neatly to modern equivalents. Schools are now made from plasticized blocks that snap together, for example, while recess features virtual batting practice and a &#8220;smart trampoline.&#8221; Recreational activities include magnetized hovering skateboards and a virtual-reality &#8220;Fanta-trek Center.&#8221; Some social changes are briefly noted, such as new career paths and the increase of marriages between different ethnicities. Interaction with the natural world is not mentioned, although many of the new technologies have eco-friendly components and the food is all meatless and delicious. </p>

  <div class="body"><p><strong>The hook:</strong> Stellaluna is a baby fruit bat happily flying along with her mother when an owl attacks. The poor little bat is knocked out of her mother&#8217;s grasp and lands in a birds&#8217; nest. The mother bird accepts Stellaluna as long as she acts like a bird, not a bat. Soon enough, Stellaluna learns to eat bugs and stop hanging by her feet. When she finally has a chance to show her bird siblings, Pip, Flutter and Flap, what life as a bat is like, they are left all in a muddle: &#8220;How can we be so different and feel so much alike?&#8221; one asks. Anyone who has ever been in a position where they can&#8217;t be who they really are will relate to Stellaluna&#8217;s predicament. Cannon&#8217;s award-winning illustrations convey the nocturnal world beautifully. Readers will be enchanted by this book with its messages of acceptance, friendship and a mothers&#8217; love.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Jane Yolen retells familiar fairy tales in a brief and lively style, while her daughter, co-author Heidi Stemple, pairs them with at least one kid-friendly recipe that connects with the story&#8217;s theme or references. For example, &#8220;Cinderella&#8221; is presented with a recipe for pumpkin tarts, while &#8220;The Runaway Pancake&#8221; is matched with, of course, a recipe for pancakes. The tales are divided into four sections: breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. The colorful illustrations add to the fun, and margin notes provide additional information on main ingredients and the stories and their origins. Adult supervision will be necessary for completing the recipes, but this book would be a great way for the whole family to share a reading and eating experience.</p>

    by:
  <em>Margaret Peterson Haddix</em>, illustrated by:<em> Mark Elliott</em> - (Simon & Schuster, 2007) <em>144 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Dexter is tough! On the first day of school, he lashes out when he trips and the other kids laugh at him. He punches another kid in the bathroom. But like so many kids with a gruff demeanor, Dexter is acting out because of a painful circumstance at home. He learns to express his emotions because of a gifted teacher and a writing assignment. I can think of no better lesson for a child to learn &mdash; feelings come out, one way or another &mdash; and finding a healthy way to sort them out is important. Perfect for a third-grader who has been bullied, or who can be too tough with others.</p>

    by:
  <em>Chris Van Allsburg</em> - (Houghton Mifflin, 1988) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>A Caldecott Medal author, Van Allsburg takes us into the world of ants. The story begins when a scout brings his queen a strange new treasure, a crystal that appeals to her sweet tooth. The ants want to please &#8220;the mother of them all,&#8221; so they march off in search of more crystals for their queen. They trek through woods (grass) and survive a thunderstorm (the sound of crickets combined with dropping dew drops and the light of a passing firefly). They climb a mountain (the wall of a house) and go through a tunnel (window) to a glassy curved wall (sugar bowl). In their haste to leave &#8220;this unnatural place,&#8221; they fail to notice that two have stayed behind to enjoy the feast. The artwork lends itself to the sense of mystery, all bold lines and earth tones. Will they make it home? Read the book and find out.</p>

We were left with the Budwing brothers as they stumbled upon the mysterious box. When they open the box, they see the Jumanji game board and another space-themed board. This board transports the players from earth to a purple planet called Zathura. Before they know it the boys are swept up in a nail-biting, outer-space adventure. Will they survive a black hole, space ships and robots? This is a must read if you&#8217;ve always wondered what happened to Danny and Walter Budwing.</p>

  <div class="body"><p><strong>The hook:</strong> The sixth installment of the Babymouse series finds our heroine at summer camp. She doesn&#8217;t like the great outdoors, but that fact shouldn&#8217;t get in the way of her having fun, right? Babymouse has her usual daydreams of how she&#8217;ll be the best camper around, but all she finds is trouble. Babymouse&#8217;s cabin-mates, the Buttercups, soon become frustrated with her shenanigans, as she racks up nothing but demerits for her team. The illustrations are as fun and humorous as ever, in the familiar black, white and pink. Graphic novels are incredibly popular with tweens and teens, so it follows that younger kids want them as well. And those for the very young &mdash; especially for young girls &mdash; are few and far between, but gaining a foothold.

    by:
  <em>William Steig</em> - (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1990) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>A very cheerful story about a mouse-dentist who treats mammals bigger than himself, wearing rubbers to keep his feet dry when he&#8217;s in their mouths. Steig&#8217;s cartoony color illustrations make up the bulk of the book, and they are nothing short of urbane and funny. The climax comes when a dapperly dressed but hungry fox comes for a new gold tooth, and the quick-witted dentist saves himself from ingestion by means of his professional skills. 32 pages.</p>

    by:
  <em>Louis Sachar</em> - (Morrow Junior Books, 1995) <em>169 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Surely, Wayside School was already strange enough. The builders built a 30-story school sideways with the rooms piled one on top of another &#8211; except for the 19th floor where Miss Zarves teaches class. There is no 19th floor, and there is no Miss Zarves. Nevertheless, there is a 13th floor, where nice Mrs. Jewls presides over her eccentric pupils. Mrs. Jewls, however, takes a maternity leave. Before she returns with her little stranger, Wayside School gets a little stranger. While reading this ridiculously funny book, children will not only be laughing, they will be learning.</p>

  <em>Graeme Base</em> - (Harry N. Abrams, 1999) <em>48 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Alien fantasies come and go, but this one has focus. Base has created a universe where music, or the lack thereof, separates the planets and gives them their distinct personalities. It&#8217;s all about freedom of musical expression, as Sprocc, a young Splingtwanger-player, enters the annual competition for Worst Band in the Universe, a true award of honor. Base&#8217;s rhyming verse is delicious fun, and there is the added bonus of a CD of intergalactic songs, composed and performed by the author himself. This is a gift of cosmic proportions and hours of fun.</p>

  <em>Deborah Hopkinson</em>, illustrated by:<em> Terry Widener</em> - (Atheneum, 2003) <em>40 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This nine-part story was inspired by the life of Alta Weiss, a girl who pitched for a semi-pro men&#8217;s baseball team in 1907. Alta has a killer fastball and a hot glove that earn her the nickname &#8220;Girl Wonder.&#8221; When Alta finishes her pitching career she heads to medical school, the only woman in her graduating class. A chronology of the highlights of women in baseball concludes the book. It only took 108 years and a lawsuit for girls to get to play Little League and Hopkinson honors all the women along the way who insisted that a woman&#8217;s place was on the field.</p>

  <h2>The Golden Dream of Carlo Chuchio</h2>  <p class="mbm">
    by:
  <em>Lloyd Alexander</em> - (Henry Holt & Company, 2007) <em>306 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This book is the author&#8217;s last, a rousing, delightful adventure. There&#8217;s a fair amount of violence here, some rather brutal, though none graphically described. Many deaths occur by a variety of weapons and methods, and a major character is beaten unconscious. Families can talk about the popular literary theme of setting out into the world to find one&#8217;s fortune. Do people really do that? Do you expect to one day? Is there a modern equivalent that, perhaps, involves less violence?</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Jason&#8217;s teacher, Mr. Taylor, loves a challenge. Give him five objects and he&#8217;ll work them all into a story of his own creation. When Jason gives Mr. Taylor the &#8220;ultimate challenge&#8221; list — a penguin, a polar bear, a cactus, quicksand and a baseball — he enthralls the class with an arctic adventure. Meanwhile, in Jason&#8217;s day-to-day life, he has to take flak from his classmates when they find out that he loves to cook. And he just can&#8217;t seem to convince his chef dad to let him help out at the family restaurant. Both stories end happily — especially when Jason&#8217;s dad and classmates get a taste of his signature sandwich, the Amazin&#8217; Jason. The <em>Penguin&#8217;s Peril</em> is a testament to the power of storytelling and will inspire young readers to be true to themselves.</p>

  <em>Sara Lewis Holmes</em> - (HarperCollins, 2007) <em>184 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This is a bittersweet and uplifting story of a young girl coping with the fact that her father is hospitalized for clinical depression. &#8220;Rapunzel&#8221; (you don&#8217;t learn her real name until the end of the book) comes home one day to find the lights off and her father curled up in his favorite red chair, crying. Soon he&#8217;s in a mental institution and her mother refuses to talk about it. By chance, she finds a letter in her father&#8217;s chair addressed to a post office box. She writes to this post office box, hoping that the person her father was writing to will help her understand what is happening. Told through her letters, this novel is poignant and emotionally raw. &#8220;Rapunzel&#8221; is the type of character you immediately bring into your heart. Her humor, courage and intelligence will resonate with the reader.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>Uniquely told by weaving together the adventures of 11-year-old Maya with those of Artemisia, a wild horse in the remote Wyoming wilderness, this is a beautiful coming-of-age story about relationships and making tough decisions. With the death of her grandmother, Maya is thrust into a totally foreign lifestyle. Accustomed to a rigid and formal urban household, Maya suddenly finds herself on a rural ranch surrounded by loving and caring people. Artemisia, who runs in a herd near Maya&#8217;s new home, is also forced into a new situation when a horse round-up separates her from the rest of her herd. Discovering one another, the two develop a bond that will be tested under severe conditions. The addition of a glossary and a list of websites dealing with the subject of wild horses in America make this a must-read for any horse lover. </p>

  <h2>Ice-Cream Cones for Sale</h2>  <p class="mbm">
    by:
  <em>Elaine Greenstein</em> - (Arthur A. Levine Books, 2003) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>In spring our thoughts turn to flowers, baseball, and ICE CREAM! With winter&#8217;s chill a memory, the lines at the local Dairy Queen appear over night and everyone is ready for that first, delicious chocolate-dipped ice cream cone. In an excellent informational book, Greenstein uses careful research to answer the question, &#8220;Who was that sainted person who invented the ice cream cone?&#8221; We know ice cream cones first appeared nationally at the St. Louis World&#8217;s Fair in 1904. But there were over fifty ice cream sellers and dozens of waffle makers, so who put the two together? Five men and one woman claim they were the first to combine tasty waffles, shaped into a cone, with yummy ice cream. But the frozen delight honor goes to Italo Marchiony, an Italian immigrant who was selling ice cream cones from a push cart on the streets of New York in 1895. No one knows for sure how he came up with the idea of an edible cone to replace glass dishes, but it&#8217;s a mystery worth pondering, while licking that perfect ice cream cone, of course.</p>

  <em>Judith St. George</em>, illustrated by:<em> David Small</em> - (Philomel Books, 2000) <em>56 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Books about the presidents are usually boring, but not this one. This is a lighthearted look at the presidency, including the ages, looks, backgrounds, occupations, pets, favorite sports and personalities of the men who&#8217;ve lived in the White House. St. George outlines the positive points about being president (big house with its own swimming pool, bowling alley and movie theater) and negative points (having to dress up, never get to go anywhere alone and lots of homework). David Small&#8217;s cartoon-style illustrations add to the fun. The book concludes with the oath of office, and there is an appended list of brief biographical sketches of each of the presidents. This would be a timely read with the presidential race that&#8217;s already beginning.</p>

Finally all the lessons are put to use in the playing of two complete games. The first is a 20-move game with comments on the reasons for certain moves; next is the analysis of an actual 45-turn game played by two grand masters.</p>
