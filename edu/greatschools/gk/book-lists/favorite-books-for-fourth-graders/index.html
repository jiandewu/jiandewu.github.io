    by:
  <em>Amy Zuckerman and Jim Daly</em>, illustrated by:<em> John Manders</em> - (Dutton, 2009) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>A talking dog, a housecleaning robot and a three-dimensional &#8220;data orb&#8221; are among the many cool features that kids might enjoy in the future, according to this lighthearted look at 2030. The breezy narrative follows one boy through a typical day, highlighting many interesting aspects of his world. Fanciful cartoon drawings show a lively and appealing world full of new and intriguing activities that correspond neatly to modern equivalents. Schools are now made from plasticized blocks that snap together, for example, while recess features virtual batting practice and a &#8220;smart trampoline.&#8221; Recreational activities include magnetized hovering skateboards and a virtual-reality &#8220;Fanta-trek Center.&#8221; Some social changes are briefly noted, such as new career paths and the increase of marriages between different ethnicities. Interaction with the natural world is not mentioned, although many of the new technologies have eco-friendly components and the food is all meatless and delicious. </p>

    by:
  <em>Janell Cannon</em> - (Harcourt, 2000) <em>48 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This is the story of an unfortunate cockroach named Crickwing, called this because of a twisted wing earned when fleeing a predator. Crickwing finds he has a talent for food presentation: He is a food sculptor! He builds his creations out of roots, leaves and petals, and then eats them&#8230;when he can. Crickwing is constantly thwarted by lizards, ocelots and food-stealing monkeys. As he watches thousands of busy leaf-cutting ants, he wonders, &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t anyone bothering these little twerps?&#8221; Thus, a bully is born. Crickwing harasses the ants until their Queen orders him to be captured and offered as a sacrifice to the army ants. Luckily, kind leaf-cutters set him free, and he redeems himself by using his special talents to rid the leaf-cutters of the army ants once and for all. Cannon&#8217;s illustrations are lush and invigorating, guaranteed to enrapture the most reluctant reader.</p>

  <em>Beverly Cleary</em>, illustrated by:<em> Arthur Dorros and Tracy Dockray</em> - (W. Morrow, 1955) <em>176 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Nine-year-old Beezus is much too grown up to hang out with her little sister, Ramona, who does embarrassingly babyish things like wearing paper bunny ears and dragging around an imaginary pet lizard on a string. Beezus tries to be patient, but Ramona is impossible! This story is more than 50 years old, but today’s kids will still crack up when Ramona powders her nose with a marshmallow and takes a single bite out of every apple in the house. And they’ll sympathize with Beezus, who learns that while she’ll always love her attention-getting little sister, that doesn’t mean she always has like her.</p>
<p>Want to see the movie? Check out <em>Ramona and Beezus</em> (2010) starring Selena Gomez as Beezus, which adds elements from several books in the series to the <em>Beezus and </em><em>Ramona </em>plot.</p>

James and the Giant Peach is considered by many to be one of the finest children&#8217;s books ever written.</p>

  <em>Chris Van Allsburg</em> - (Houghton Mifflin, 1981) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Judy and Peter&#8217;s parents go to the opera, leaving them with instructions &#8220;to keep the house neat.&#8221; The children soon find themselves bored with their toys, after making a mess with them as soon as Mom and Dad have walked out the door. They go to the park, where they find a board game and bring it home only to discover that it is not the usual run-of-the-mill game. With a roll of the dice, a real lion may appear or an erupting volcano, and of course, let&#8217;s not forget the monkeys. Boredom is no longer an issue! Van Allsburg&#8217;s artistry is top notch as the children&#8217;s predicament gets more and more fantastic. The sculptured drawings and play between shadow and light demonstrate how a regular house can transform into a raging jungle. Jumanji was a New York Times Best Illustrated Book and winner of the 1982 Caldecott Medal.</p>

    by:
  <em>Demi</em> - (Simon & Schuster, 2007) <em>52 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Author/artist Demi has created another stunningly illustrated children&#8217;s book, The Boy Who Painted Dragons. It&#8217;s the story of Ping, a talented young boy who secretly fears the dragons whose images he paints. As he attempts to hide his fear, he covers every possible surface with brilliant golden dragons. When asked why he paints them, Ping lies and says, &#8220;Because I love dragons! &#8230; He is the spirit of life. He is the secret force in nature.&#8221; The book reads like an ancient folktale, carrying timeless spiritual messages about inner strength and facing one&#8217;s fears. It also puts a literal spin on the expression &#8220;pearls of wisdom&#8221; &mdash; the dragons live in heaven and collect pearls carved with words such as &#8220;Seek your heart,&#8221; or &#8220;Dare to be great.&#8221; Demi&#8217;s gold-tinged illustrations are dramatically beautiful, combining paint and ink with Chinese silk brocade.</p>

    by:
  <em>Diane Stanley</em> - (HarperCollins, 2007) <em>32 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Noted writer Diane Stanley&#8217;s newest picture book is a humorous take on both the Greek myth &#8220;Pygmalion,&#8221; and the old adage &#8220;Be careful what you wish for.&#8221; Set in ancient Greece, the story follows a young sculptor named Pyg and his quest to win the heart of a stone goddess. Observing the action is a real flesh-and-blood girl named Jane, whose own desire (to become a renowned sculptor) is far more attainable than Pyg&#8217;s. The stone goddess comes to life thanks to Pyg&#8217;s artistic talents, but his ideas of perfect beauty are severely challenged as he learns the woman is as cold and disdainful as she is lovely. Stanley&#8217;s colorful illustrations depict ancient Greece with a folk-art flair and a great eye for detail. This story teaches valuable lessons about appearances and relationships in a non-preachy manner, and even young readers can identify with Jane, recognizing before Pyg does that true beauty comes from the inside.</p>

Also, you can tell that Greg&#8217;s mom is working hard to raise respectful sons. When a bikini picture from her oldest son Rodrick&#8217;s heavy metal magazine ends up in her youngest son&#8217;s hands for show-and-tell, she makes Rodrick apologize to all women on paper. Parents will also be thrilled to know that despite the fact that the book is written in less-formal journal style with fun cartoons, everything is spelled correctly (i.e., no texting slang in sight!).</p>
<p>Want to see the movie? The 2010 film version tells the story of Greg’s quest to become popular and features lots of goofy lowbrow jokes about bodily functions.</p>

  <em>Jeff Kinney</em> - (Amulet Books, 2008) <em>224 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This book has sibling rivalry, one wild party and some scheming to cheat on tests and get out of chores. The great thing is, like most middle school kids, the characters get caught and are punished. Families can talk about lying and friendship. Why was Greg&#8217;s mother more upset when she found out he lied? How would you feel if your friends treated you like Greg did Chirag? Have you ever done something in school that made other people feel bad, but made you feel cool and popular?</p>

Dylan is obsessed with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as is Tom, the man who tried to rob them and whom they hire instead.

  <h2>No Talking</h2>  <p class="mbm">
    by:
  <em>Andrew Clements</em>, illustrated by:<em> Mark Elliott</em> - (Simon & Schuster, 2007) <em>146 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This is an ear-to-ear-grinningly delightful school story. Parents need to know that there is nothing to be concerned about here and lots to cheer. It&#8217;s a story that even reluctant readers can love, about good-hearted children and adults who grow in compassion and understanding. Families can talk about silence and civil disobedience. Why does the silence seem so powerful? How does it change everyone&#8217;s perceptions? What do you think of the standoff between Dave and the principal?</p>

    by:
  <em>Gary Blackwood</em> - (Puffin Books, 1998) <em>216 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>Fourteen-year-old orphan Widge works for a mean and unscrupulous master who goes by the name of Falconer. Ordered to steal the script for Hamlet, Widge is taken to London and forced to attend a performance of the play. Instead of concentrating on stealing the script, he becomes engrossed in the show. Reluctantly, Widge admits his failure to Falconer and is told to return until his mission is accomplished. Nothing goes as planned and a very surprised Widge finds himself an accepted member of the backstage crew. Once a lonely outcast, he has friends and a place to call home for the first time in his life. Will he have the moral integrity to disobey his master or will he betray his new family? Set in Elizabethan London, The Shakespeare Stealer introduces us to Shakespearean stagecraft, life on the streets of London and to the truth behind the youthful appearance of Queen Elizabeth I! </p>

This was her first sighting of Dustfinger, one of many colorful characters that her father brought to life from the pages of the book Inkheart.

Now, the evil Capricorn wants another character brought to life, and is determined to have Mo read aloud. This fascinating multi-layered story is an enjoyable but dark read for anyone who loves a good story within a story.</p>

    by:

  <div class="body"><p>A pilot crashes in the Sahara Desert. A thousand miles from any habitation, while attempting to fix his plane, he meets a strangely dressed little boy who seems to have come from nowhere, and who demands that he draw a sheep. &#8220;When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey,&#8221; so the pilot attempts to draw a sheep. Gradually the Little Prince reveals his story. He comes from a small asteroid, where he lives alone until a rose grows there. But the rose is demanding, and he is confused by his feelings about her. Eventually he decides to leave and journey to other planets in search of knowledge. After meeting many confusing adults, he eventually lands on Earth, where he befriends a snake and a fox. The fox helps him to understand the rose, and the snake offers to help him return to his planet &mdash; but at a price. Many adults look back on this book with a catch in the throat and have a special place for it in their hearts. This gentle picture book, concerned with the true &#8220;matters of consequence,&#8221; was as much a part of growing up for those of a certain age as The Lord of the Rings or the Beatles. There quite literally has never been anything like it, though others have certainly tried.</p>
