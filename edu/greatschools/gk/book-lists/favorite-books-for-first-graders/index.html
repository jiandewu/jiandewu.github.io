In a sly dig at reviewers and reviewing, he cuts up a publication that looks &mdash; suspiciously &mdash; like the New York Times Book Review and collects piles of words in a potpourri of fonts. Words, of course, lead to story &#8230; and pretty soon all three brothers are happily engaged in creating a tale about a brown worm, a green snake and a mean crocodile.</p>

    by:
  <em>Kate Bernheimer</em>, illustrated by:<em> Nicoletta Ceccoli</em> - (Schwartz & Wade, 2008) <em>40 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>This is a layered story that weaves in and out, up and down, to form a fascinating fantasy. The haunting scene of a wispy, wistful girl peering into the glass case on the cover starts the journey. Inside the case, the girl in the castle, lonely in her turret, appears to be lost in a dreamlike trance. Yet as the story unfolds, the reader learns that the girl in the castle misses the children when they leave the museum and dreams of their return. She even dreams of the reader, who is, in the end, invited to leave his/her picture above the girl&#8217;s bed inside the castle, inside the glass case, inside the museum, inside the book that the reader is holding. Much like the Escher-like stairways of the illustrations, the three worlds intersect and blend into an unexpected story. And, with characters that look like dolls, dolls that look like porcelain figures from a Dali painting, strange toys, and hazy dream-like colors sparked here and there with a magical light, Bernheimer and Ceccoli have created a mesmerizing fantasy world that is both uniquely surreal, yet comfortingly real and loving. </p>

  <div class="body"><p>This is a special book. Each page-spread is a poem, and together the poems tell the story of a bi-racial, blended family overcoming the trials and tribulations of learning to live and love together. Xavier&#8217;s mom has just married Chris&#8217; dad. To Xavier, the house feels too small, the love not enough for two, and just about everything Chris does, Xavier sees as ill-intentioned or competitive. But that makes the book sound heavy when indeed these are witty, moving poems that skip, sink, soar and take unexpected twists, along with the little boy&#8217;s emotions. When the brothers work things out and find joy in each other, my 5-year-old daughter in my lap was full of happiness and bounce. The pictures are energetic, expressive and colorful, and more than match the text &mdash; they give it life and whimsy.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>This sly reversal of the typical older-sibling-jealous-of-the-new-baby picture book tells the story of Rosemary Emma Angela Lynette Isabel Iris Malone, so-saddled because every relative in the extended family took a hand in the naming. Everyone, in fact, from Uncle Jeff to Aunt Barbara to the unnamed grandparents hangs on Rosemary&#8217;s every need until her life gives new meaning to the term &#8220;cosseted.&#8221; Eventually, she comes to the conclusion that being the target of everyone&#8217;s affection is hard work and she takes her complaints all the way to the top. &#8220;You need to have another kid right away,&#8221; she tells her mother, hands firmly planted on her hips. &#8220;And that&#8217;s that.&#8221; In the end, all is resolved to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction, though not in the way Rosemary demands or even imagines, and the clever title changes from a statement of fact to an open-ended question.</p>

When the children learn the truth, they are given the chance for self-reflection. The lessons learned here will last your child a lifetime. </p>

One day he discovers an image in a book that speaks to his heart: &#8220;It showed pictures of the most beautiful shapes and colors, and called them flowers.&#8221; He searches the city for traces of this beauty and discovers a pack of seeds at a junk shop. The Flower has a subtlety that intrigues both older and younger children who totally get it. I&#8217;ve had wonderful responses — joyful and vigorous affirmations of how they love, love, love flowers. And they draw lots of them after reading this book, so have some paper and crayons handy!</p>

What&#8217;s more, the delivery continues with one penguin for each day until, by the end of the year, their house is so stuffed with penguins that the family has to celebrate a cold New Year&#8217;s Eve out on their front lawn. This picture book is fantastic in more ways than one — the story is imaginative and even includes counting concepts for some educational appeal — and the illustrations really put it over the top; they&#8217;re bold and simple with a retro appeal.

Odanaka isn&#8217;t afraid to be realistic; her smiley garbage men wear &#8220;Greasy gloves . . .sticky boots . . .stains a-plenty on their suits,&#8221; and there are flies &#8220;a-buzzin&#8217; by the dozen.&#8221; Will Hillenbrand&#8217;s vivid ink and egg tempera illustrations bring all these stinky details to life &mdash; including the truck itself, which gobbles up everything with gusto. There&#8217;s a definite gross-out element to the book, but Odanaka&#8217;s rhyming text and enthusiastic look at an important job make this entirely suitable for small children. </p>

  <em>Meghan McCarthy</em> - (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006) <em>34 pages.</em>  </p>
  <div class="body"><p>On one level this picture book seems to be a science fiction story of aliens from Mars landing on Earth. It is actually the story of Orson Welles&#8217; famous 1938 live radio broadcast of H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds, which caused panic and hysteria across the country despite broadcast disclaimers that it was only a play. The book begins with a radio announcer explaining the important role that radio played in the lives of Americans during the &#8217;30s, which will probably be surprising to many young readers. McCarthy uses the illustrations to distinguish fact from fiction by presenting real-life scenes in black and white and the fictional radio play in color. The amusing illustrations add to the book&#8217;s appeal, with the humans&#8217; buggy eyes looking strangely similar to the buggy eyes of the Martian aliens.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>This photo essay chronicles the rescue, treatment and ultimate release back to the ocean of a critically ill loggerhead sea turtle at the South Carolina Aquarium. Although the author goes beyond describing the turtle&#8217;s observable behavior by attributing human emotions to the creature, this book might be comforting to kids going through difficult medical treatment and would certainly be of interest to any young animal lovers. The large print and simple vocabulary format should be accessible for beginning readers.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>OK, not to be overly technical, but not all of these creepy-crawlies are insects — some are arachnids, diplopods, or crustaceans. But they&#8217;re all pretty icky. Author Jerry Palotta chose 26 subjects, including stinkbugs, pill bugs, and periodical cicadas. Not only will kids learn that blister beetles are used for medicine and that honey pot ants make delicious snacks, but discerning readers will also notice that this is an ABC book in reverse, beginning with one zebra swallowtail butterfly and ending with 26 army ants.</p>

  <div class="body"><p>The words &#8220;You are mostly made of water&#8221; start a young boy on a mysterious exploration of that very substance. He moves from fear (&#8220;If his cat scratched him, would all the water leak out?&#8221;) to kinship (&#8220;When he stood on the cliffs, the waves sang to him&#8221;) and finally to control (&#8220;He was able to toss water from a glass and have it come snapping back, like a yo-yo&#8221;). The lack of a name (he is always called &#8220;the boy&#8221;) and the deliberate cadence of the sentences give this book a sense of universality and solemnity while the luminous images — lit by a strange interior light — lend a dreamlike quality to every scene. This is a book that will appeal to the quiet, inquiring, and introspective child who sees &mdash; or seeks &mdash; mystery and magic in the everyday world.</p>

In between, <em>Stars</em> explores all sorts of other places where stars can be found, both literally and figuratively: on pajamas or school papers; in snowflakes or the flowers in a pumpkin patch. A star can transform a stick into a magic wand or a kid into a sheriff. Ray’s simple prose and Frazee’s playful illustrations combine to create a lovely stream-of-consciousness feel that encourages a child&#8217;s mind to wander and wonder.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Reading with your child is sure to spark conversation and inspire star-related crafts and a star hunt of your own.</p>
