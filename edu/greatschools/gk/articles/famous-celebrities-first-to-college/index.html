Forging a path your own parents didn’t take &mdash; they don’t know what it’s like to live in a dorm, chose a major, or face a week of exams &mdash; can make students <a href="../struggles-first-generation-college-students-face/index.html">feel overwhelmed and unsupported</a>.

For inspiration, here’s a list of people who’ve blazed this trail, including presidents, Supreme Court judges, award-winning artists, world leaders, and billionaires. </p><p><strong>Michael Blecker</strong> is the executive director of <a href="https://www.swords-to-plowshares.org/">Swords to Plowshares</a>, a nonprofit organization that provides support and advocacy for U.S. veterans.
