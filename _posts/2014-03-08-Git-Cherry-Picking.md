First of all, use git log to see exactly which commit you want to pick. An example:

```
 dd2e86 - 946992 - 9143a9 - a6fd86 - 5a6057 [master]
             \
              76cada - 62ecb3 - b886a0 [feature]
```

In this case, `62ecb3` is the cherry and you want to pick it!

```
$ git checkout master
$ git cherry-pick 62ecb3
```

That’s all. `62ecb3` is now applied to the master branch and commited (as a new commit) in master. cherry-pick behaves just like merge.

You could also just grab config.xml from the development branch:

```bash
$ git checkout testing
$ git checkout development -- config.xml
```

That'll get you the same version of config.xml that exists in the development branch, but note that it won't pull in the history of changes to the file.
