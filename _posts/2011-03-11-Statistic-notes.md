## mean, median and related area thinking

If a quantity has a density function $$p(x)$$, then we define the **mean** value of the quantity as $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xp(x)$$.

A **median** of a quantity $$x$$ distributed through a population is a value $$T$$ such that half of the population has values of $$x$$ less than $$T$$ and half the population has values of $$x$$ greater than $$T$$. That is, $$T$$ satisfies the equation $$\int_{-\infty}^{T}p(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}$$.
