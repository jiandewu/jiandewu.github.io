## mean, median and related area thinking

If a quantity has a density function $$p(x)$$, then we define the **mean** value of the quantity as $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xp(x)$$.

A **median** of a quantity $$x$$ distributed through a population is a value $$T$$ such that half of the population has values of $$x$$ less than $$T$$ and half the population has values of $$x$$ greater than $$T$$. That is, $$T$$ satisfies the equation $$\int_{-\infty}^{T}p(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}$$.

## The law of large  numbers

If some event has a given probability (like throwing a single die and having it land with the six side up) and if we run  dentical trials over and over again, the proportion of times that event occurs will get closer and closer to the probability.

## THE  CENTRAL LIMIT  THEOREM

The averages of large collections of numbers have a statistical distribution. The central limit theorem states that this  distribution can be approximated by the normal probability distribution regardless of where the initial data came from.
